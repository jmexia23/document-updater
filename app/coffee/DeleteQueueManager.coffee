# Maintain a sorted set of project flushAndDelete requests, ordered by timestamp
# (ZADD), and process them from oldest to newest. A flushAndDelete request comes
# from real-time and is triggered when a user leaves a project. 
#
# The aim is to remove the project from redis 5 minutes after the last request
# if there has been no activity (document updates) in that time.  If there is
# activity we can expect a further flushAndDelete request when the editing user
# leaves the project. 
#
# If a new flushAndDelete request comes in while an existing request is already
# in the queue we update the timestamp as we can postpone flushing further.
#
# Documents are processed by checking the queue, seeing if the first entry is
# older than 5 minutes, and popping it from the queue in that case.
